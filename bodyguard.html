          <h2>Overview üìò</h2>
          <p>
            <br>
            One of my key projects as a UX Designer on the Alexa Human Effects (HFX) team was ‚ÄúBodyguard‚Äù,  a feature designed to improve user safety by detecting environmental sounds while using noise-canceling earbuds. This feature was born out of customer research suggesting its usefulness and consumer desire. I synthesized research data to advocate for this feature, designed its user experience, and iterated based on stakeholder feedback.
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section-container">
          <h2>
            The Problem üí¢
          </h2>
          <p><br>
            When users wear earbuds‚Äîespecially with active noise cancellation (ANC)‚Äîthey become less aware of their surroundings, which can pose safety risks. The challenge was to design a feature that could make users situationally aware.

            <h2>Research üîç</h2>
            <p>
              <br>
              I synthesized internal research and customer surveys to identify user needs. Key takeaways included:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Being warned of danger was a highly desired job to be done from technology for both Alexa and non-Alexa users.</li>
                <li>There was a strong demand for hearables to detect and notify users of important environmental sounds.</li>
                
            </ul>

          </div>

          <div class="section-container">
            <h2>Defining the Feature üîâ</h2>
            <p>
              <br>
              Based on this research, I narrowed down on designing a feature for Echo Buds that could detect certain sounds - but which sounds? I created a sound priority list based on:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Survey data on customer preferences for sound detection.</li>
                <li>User scenarios where situational awareness would be most beneficial to their safety.</li>
                <li>Pre-existing sound detection models for other Alexa products that could be leveraged.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>
                A key limitation to chosen sounds was Alexa's inherent processing latency on Echo Buds, which affected real-time sound detection. This meant that some urgent sounds might not be useful for immediate intervention, leading to certain sounds being deprioritized for being less useful in such scenarios.
            </p>

        <div class="section-container">
        <h2>Design üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
        <p><br>
            After mapping out user workflows and iterating on the user experience based on research and feedback from the team, I created documentation and audio demos demonstrating the user experience of Echo Buds reacting to long-duration sounds and short-duration sounds.<br><br>

            Depending on the state of the Echo Buds at the time of interruption (music, podcast, calls, nothing), I outlined:
            <br><Br>

            <ul>
                <li>Whether audio playback should be ducked or paused</li>
                <li>Whether a sound cue (earcon) or text-to-speech notification was sent.</li>                
            </ul>

            <p>
                These specifications adhered to Alexa‚Äôs voice interruption design guidelines. 
            </p>

            <Br>
      
        </div>


        <div class="section-container">
          <h2>
              Next Steps ü§î
          </h2>
          <p>
            <br>
            The findings and workflow I created were incorporated into the product roadmap, allowing engineers and product managers to refine the feature further. Follow-ups I recommended included:            <br><Br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The development team should optimize sensitivity thresholds</strong> to balance when an interruption was triggered while minimizing false positives.</li>
                <li><strong>The audio engineering team should design a unique sound cue (earcon)</strong> to help users intuitively recognize Bodyguard alerts.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider designing beyond safety-related sounds. </strong> The sound list I created prioritized safety. But if we had the opportunity to expand upon the feature, users could find value in detecting other sounds that were not directly related to safety.</li>
                
            </ul>
